description: Authenticate API for Zesty.io Users

# Auth API

Auth API is used to authenticate users with Zesty.io, which returns a token that grants to access services like Instances API, Accounts API, and Media API. Auth was setup as a stand alone service so it could connect to many services in our platform.

Permissions are managed at the service level, for example, to manage permissions on instances, you would use the [Accounts API](https://accounts-api.zesty.io/) to do so
