# Blueprints

### Overview

Blueprints consist of an XML plate, which serves as the basis for the Schema structure, as well as a styles, JavaScript, and view files, and sometimes sample content. 

Users can only manage Blueprints if developer settings are switched on via their account settings. 

We'll review the Blueprints interface below.
