# Resource Resolution Order

When a request is served by WebEngine, it reads the url path and attempts to match the url path to a content item resources. URL are checked against resource in a specific order, and will resolve the resource first if a match is found. If two resources share a URL path, then the one that loads first will resolve and the other is ignored.

**Resource load order:**

1. Static files generated by Zesty.io: site.css and site.js
2. Instant JSON API _e.g. /-/instant/7-zyx-zyxzyc.json_
3. GQL API _e.g. /-/gql/\*_
4. Static files generated by Zesty.io: _sitemap.xml, feed.xml, robots.txt_
5. Legacy JSON endpoints _e.g. /-/custom/_
6. Well Known Files _e.g. /.well-known/\*_
7. Custom endpoints _e.g. /custom/endpoints.json_
8. Legacy HTML endpoints _e.g. /ajax/_ 
9. Content Models Views if a content item's meta path matches the request page _e.g. /about/team/_
10. Wild Card Views e.g. _/store/\*/cool-shirt/_
11. 301 redirects
12. 404 Pages e.g. when no resources match the url pattern
