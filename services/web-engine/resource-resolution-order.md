# Resource Resolution

When a request is served by WebEngine, it reads the url path and attempts to match the url path to a content item resources. URL are checked against resource in a specific order, and will resolve the resource first if a match is found. If two resources share a URL path, then the one that loads first will resolve and the other is ignored.

**Resource load order:**

1. Static files generated by Zesty.io: site.css and site.js
2. Instant JSON API _e.g. /-/instant/7-zyx-zyxzyc.json_
3. GQL API _e.g. /-/gql/\*_
4. Static files generated by Zesty.io: _sitemap.xml, feed.xml, robots.txt_
5. Legacy JSON endpoints _e.g. /-/custom/_
6. Well Known Files _e.g. /.well-known/\*_
7. Custom endpoints _e.g. /custom/endpoints.json_
8. Legacy HTML endpoints _e.g. /ajax/_ 
9. Content Models Views if a content item's meta path matches the request page _e.g. /about/team/_
10. Wild Card Views e.g. _/store/\*/cool-shirt/_
11. 301 redirects
12. 404 Pages e.g. when no resources match the url pattern

### Base Directory Setting

Zesty.io will default all automated assets to the root `/` directory unless there is a setting on the instance with category:`general` key:`base_directory` with a directory set as its value e.g. `/blog/`

**Automated files this rule apply to:**

* site.js
* site.css
* sitemap.xml
* robots.txt
* feed.xml
* [Instant JSON API](../../apis/instant-content-api.md)
* [GQL API](../../apis/graphql.md)

Other files created in the code editor must be manually named to follow the path of your choice. Content items must also be parent to a content item with the base name of your choice. For example if you are using Zesty.io WebEngine for only the `/blog/` path of your website you need to setup a content item as a holder with the path `/blog/` as its URL, and also create a setting with category:`general` key:`base_directory`   with the value `/blog/`
