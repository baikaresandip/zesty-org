# Styles

### What are style Variables?

Style Variables part of the Settings Section that provides a non-technical interface for updating style variables.

When it comes to style sheets, you have the option of using LESS, SCSS, or CSS. Zesty.io is equipped to compile style sheets written in LESS or SCSS so there is no need to install any precompilers to use these languages. Simply create your style sheet and the rest is taken care of.

### Editing your variables

Style Variables can be found as a subsection in the Settings section. The left-hand sidebar has all the available categories while the main content to the right has the editable fields for you to start customizing the variables. The available style variables will depend on your selected Blueprint. In order for the style variables to work they must be set up in the Editor.

### Accessing your variables in Parsley

In the Editor section, you can add your style variables to a LESS/SCSS file in the under Style Sheets section. A list of the variable names is available in the Styles subsection. Add those variable names to your style sheet.

In this example, we will be calling the Body Background Color variable. The variable name is shown on the right: `@body-bg-color`. Add this variable to your style sheet file using the reference name `@body-bg-color` to define a style property.
