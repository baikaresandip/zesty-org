# Schema

### Overview

The Schema section is essential for the initial build process and continues to be the starting point for major updates and additions to instances. An instance which uses the Schema section well creates an intuitive interface for content editors and a smooth build process for developers.

The Schema section is made up of three sections: the Content Structure, the Less Variables, and the Site Settings. This article will give a brief over of each section. More details are available in additional articles.

### Content Structure

The Content Structure is where content models and fields are created, edited, and deactivated. There are three types of Content Models: single pages, page groups, and data sets. The purpose and differences between each are outlined in the article [Content Models](/content-models/).

There are over 20 types of fields from basic text fields to dynamic relational content fields. Each content component has two names, a Display Name and a Reference Name. The display name is used in the Content section and the reference name is used in Parsley in the Editor section. Click this article to learn more about [Fields](/adding-fields/).
