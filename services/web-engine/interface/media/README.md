# Media

### Overview

The Media tab is where all of an instance's media is organized. All types of files can be uploaded, including SVG, PDF, MOV, Mp4, GIF, JPEG, PDF, and more.

### Groups

Media can be organized into groups, groups can be nested, and media can be moved between groups. These groups are only visual representations used in the interface and do not affect the path of the image.

### EcoBins

Properties can have EcoBins which allow specific group media to be shared across properties.
