# Sitemap Priority

A sitemap is a file which lists all of your sites urls and their priorities. These are used to inform search engines what urls on your site are available for crawling. This will not guarantee that a page is indexed by a crawler but provides hints for the crawler on how best to crawl your site.

Zesty.io automatically generates a `sitemap.xml` for every site and automatically sets url crawl priority. All sitemaps are located at `https://www.your-domain/sitemap.xml`.

Each page has its own sitemap priority which is located in a page's settings. This dropdown will allow you to set the page's numerical priority, including an option to remove your page from the sitemap.

Google also provides great resources for those looking to [understand more about sitemaps](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en&ref_topic=4581190).
