# Canonical Tags



Canonical tags help search engines understand authoritative links and can help prevent duplicate content issues.

Your site can automatically generate canonical tags.

### Enabling Canonical Tags

1. Go to the "Schema" section in the content management interface.
2. Go to the "Site Settings" sub-tab
3. Select "SEO" from the left sidebar
4. Click "Enable Canonical Tags"

### Canonical Tag Modes

Each page has its own canonical tag settings \(though the default setting is typically appropriate\).

* **Off** — No canonical tag will be rendered
* **On** \(Default\) — This automatically generates a self-referential canonical tag and removes query parameters
* **On – Allow certain parameters** — This also automatically generates a self-referential canonical tag, but allows the query parameters you list to be included
* **On – Custom Path** — This generates the first part of the URL \(including the correct http/https and www/non-www setting\), but uses the custom path you specify
