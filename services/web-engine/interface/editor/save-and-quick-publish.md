# Save and Quick Publish

### Save Verision

On the top right, you can see the Save, Review and Publish, and Delete buttons for the property's files. Hold down the Option button \(Alt on PC\) on your keybord and you'll see a couple of new options.

Save Version will do a complete backup of your property. It is good practice to do this every so often. If something goes terribly wrong and we need to revert to a backup, we'll use the previously saved version.

### Quick Publish

When you hit Review and Publish in the Editor, the interface will display a side-by-side comparision of your code edits before publishing. If you would like to bypass this notification, you can click Quick Publish as you are holding down the Option button on your keyboard.
