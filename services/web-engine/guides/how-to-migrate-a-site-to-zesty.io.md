# How to Migrate a Site to Zesty.io

## How to migrate a site to Zesty.io

If you have been considering using Zesty.io, but already have a functioning website on another platform, we can help you seamlessly and easily transfer it to Zesty.io. In order to help you cut down on migration time, we've implemented the following key features to help you move your website in a short amount of time.

### Drag and Drop code importer:

One of our best tools is the ability to drag and drop a text file, directly into the Zesty.io interface. This can be done through our Editor section, on the side bar. In the picture below you can see a file about to be dropped into the Zesty.io interface.

Compared to other solutions where an FTP or SCP file transfer is the best solution, we believe that this method is a more straightforward way to import non-native code into the platform.

### Zesty.io Google WebMasters Integration:

You can transfer all links with Zesty.io through our tool that integrates with Google Webmaster. This is useful if you have changed the links on your website; for instance migrating a website to a new platform. ![Image call three](https://wyp1jm.media.zestyio.com/image09.png)

It is important to note that this is especially useful for such cases as somebody placing a link from an old version of your website in documentation, or perhaps just a favorite in their browser. Zesty.io, will work with Google Webmaster to import the link information from Google and allow you to redirect every link that is entered there through setting up a simple 301 redirect. In order to do this, you will need to connect your website to Google Webmaster tools. This is a relatively simple process and the steps can be found [here](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en).
