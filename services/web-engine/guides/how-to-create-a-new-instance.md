### Step 2: Select a Blueprint

A blueprint is your instance's base which can contain pre-built CSS, HTML, and JavaScript \(commonly referred to as framework\) as well as Pages, and Entry sets. Zesty.io provides a few options for blueprints with popular frameworks with preset pages and entry sets to help you get started. You can also create your own blueprint via GitHub. If you don't want any preset options, you can select blank slate.

### Step 3: Access and Roles

Create users who can access your new instance and set their roles or access limitations. These settings can be updated at any time by clicking the cog icon on your instance in the Account Manager. Click Close on the top right of the panel to go back to the Account Manager.
