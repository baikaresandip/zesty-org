# How to Set up Google Analytics

Before sending your site live don't forget to hook up Google Analytics!

From the _Content_ tab, click the _"Authorize Google Analytics"_ button which will open a Google form requesting access to your analytics profile.

Clicking _"Allow Access"_ will process your request and, if all is successful, the page will refresh and an analytics tab will show up in the main navigation.

**Note:** if the popup turns dark blue saying website could not be found, you must first register your site with [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/).

Once verified, if you have an active account with current analytics you should see data appear in the chart. Do not worry if it's empty, it just means you have not had analytics configured for that web domain. Now that Google Analytics is installed you will begin to see your page level analytics. Enjoy!
