# Code Bank

### Overview

The code bank is located in the bottom quarter of the Editor section which we call the editor utilities. The snippets of code are contextually made available from a combination of Zesty.io defaults and fields the developer has configured as part of the content schema.

### How to use the Code Bank

1. Ensure that you've opened the file that you want to edit. 
2. Scroll through the Parsley snippets in the code bank until you find the code snippet that you need. 
3. Drag and drop that piece of code into the main window of the Editor interface.  

Repeat these steps as often as you need to in order to code your views.
