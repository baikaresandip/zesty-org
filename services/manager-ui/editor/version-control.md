# Version Control

### Overview

Zesty.io uses a two-stage approach to version control \(as opposed to more complex version control systems\). Each environment \(dev and live\) has its own set of HTML, stylesheets, and Javascript files.

### Previewing changes

The development changes can be previewed via a staging site link. The stage link can be used with clients when walking-though builds. Access to the staging site can, optionally, be limited to specific IP addresses or a range of IP addresses.

### Publishing Changes

In the development environment, template files can be individually edited and published to production. There is also a "Publish All" button to send all development file changes live at the same time.
