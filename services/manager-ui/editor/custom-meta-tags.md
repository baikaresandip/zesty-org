# Custom Meta Tags

### Overview

These custom meta tags are global and are a great place to provide development specific meta information such as viewport, device, character set, etc.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can drag the footer drawer up or down to have a custom viewport for easy editing.
{% endhint %}

### **Creating custom meta tags**

Custom meta tags can be added in the Editor section under the editor utilities under "Doctype / Favicon / Metatags" section. The following steps will tell you how to access and create them: 

1. Locate the editor utilities section and click on the "Doctype / Favicon / Metatags" button. 
2. Locate the Current Meta Tags section \(scroll if necessary\).
3. Hover over the Attribute Key and a textbox will appear. Click in the textbox and enter your attribute key.
4. Repeat the above steps with Attribute Value, Value Key, and Meta Value to complete your meta tag
5. Once the meta tag is complete click the "+" button at the end of the row to add the meta tag.

#### **Deleting custom meta tags**

If you need to remove a custom meta tag click the trash can icon at right end of the row of the tag that you want to delete.

### Doctype

You can also modify the Document Type Definition for your property if you are using a legacy HTML version.

### Favicon

A favicon can be added to your instance via the editor utilities in the Editor section. A 16 x 16 png or ico image will work best.

Follow these steps to add a favicon:

1. Locate the editor utilities section and click on the "Doctype / Favicon / Metatags" button.
2. Locate the field named Current Favicon
3. Add a new favicon:
4. If you're **replacing** a favicon then delete the current favicon by clicking the "x" in the corner of the image to remove it and then add your new favicon.
5. If you're simply adding a favicon then click the gray "Add Images" button, select your favicon from the media modal, and then click the green "load selected files" button to confirm your selection. 
6. Your new favicon has been added.
