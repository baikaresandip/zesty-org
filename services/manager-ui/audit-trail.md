# Audit Trail

Audit Trail TM allows users to see recently created, edited, and deleted items. Items and content models are noted by their ZUID. Users can see the user who modified the item\(s\), a date/timestamp, and item and content model ZUID. Depending on your configuration this section might not be available to you.

![Audit Trail logs show which pieces of content were created, modified, and deleted. ](../../.gitbook/assets/audit-trail-screenshot.png)
