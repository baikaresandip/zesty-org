# Getting Started

## What is Zesty.io?

Zesty.io is a cloud web content management system \(WCMS\) that is API driven with open-source user interfaces. Our software is built to automate the configuration, optimization, and distribution of digital content so marketing teams and developers can focus on creating excellent digital experiences.

#### What makes Zesty.io different?

Zesty.io delivers the same experience as a traditional content management systems \(CMS\), but does much more as it is a cloud software service. We are constantly improving our technology, often daily, with updates that positively affect all users and experiences built on the platform.

{% tab title="Easy CMS" %}
We see content as a blank canvas, and because of that, we made a system that allows for any content configuration that is easy for any user to work with. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Asset Sharing" %}
Traditionally, content is siloed to the experience it was created for, and often locked up the software installation it was created on. With Zesty.io, content can be shared between different instances and experience built outside of the Zesty.io system.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Deliver at Edge" %}
Experience need to be delivered fast. Whether it is a JSON API call or a full website page loading, we make sure that all requests are cached at the edge to ensure your end-user is delivered a fast experience without thinking about load time or uptime.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Headless Applications" %}
The ability to repurpose content to work on multiple devices like phones, browsers, and smart devices gives business' marketing teams and developers the upper hand with non-siloed content and short term experiences.

## About Zesty.io

Zesty.io was founded in 2010 by Randy Apuzzo and Andy Fleming in the basement of Randy's Little Italy loft in San Diego, California. Prior to that, Randy had been building custom websites and software for various businesses since 2004. Randy and Andy leveraged Randy's customer base to test and build different aspects of the platform out. In 2011, Andy left his full time job to work with Randy to build out Zesty.io, bootstrapped on the heels of their consulting work. 

Zesty.io's unique configuration allowed it to power content on both ecommerce and informational based websites. The headless nature of Zesty.io enabled Randy and Andy to quickly transition customers from on Wordpress, Joomla, and Magento. To continue bootstrapping development of the software, they partnering with marketing agencies in San Diego, Sacramento, and Las Vegas. Their partners relationships helped fuel development of Zesty.io until 2014, when they raised capital from San Diego based technology angel investors. During the capital raise, Gerry Widmer joined the team and set the platform's focus on servicing mid-market and enterprise needs. Zesty.io has doubled in size and usage every year since.
