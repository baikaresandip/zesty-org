## About Zesty.io

Zesty.io was founded in 2010 by Randy Apuzzo and Andy Fleming in the basement of Randy's Little Italy loft in San Diego, California. Prior to that, Randy had been building custom websites and software for various businesses since 2004. Randy and Andy leveraged Randy's customer base to test and build different aspects of the platform out. In 2011, Andy left his full time job to work with Randy to build out Zesty.io, bootstrapped on the heels of their consulting work. 

Zesty.io's unique configuration allowed it to power content on both ecommerce and informational based websites. The headless nature of Zesty.io enabled Randy and Andy to quickly transition customers from on Wordpress, Joomla, and Magento. To continue bootstrapping development of the software, they partnering with marketing agencies in San Diego, Sacramento, and Las Vegas. Their partners relationships helped fuel development of Zesty.io until 2014, when they raised capital from San Diego based technology angel investors. During the capital raise, Gerry Widmer joined the team and set the platform's focus on servicing mid-market and enterprise needs. Zesty.io has doubled in size and usage every year since.
