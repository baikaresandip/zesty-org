# Content Instance

## What is a Cloud Content Instance?

Content Instances are implementations of Zesty.io used to create and manage text, image, or video based content that is distributed to digital presentations. Digital presentation can include, but are not limited to: websites, web and mobile applications, video game consoles, Alexa apps, Roku apps, digital signage, etc.. Content Instances are set to replace traditional content management systems. 

### What type of Content Can be Stored?

Traditionally, Zesty.io has been used for brochure style, public marketing content, that is most commonly distributed through websites. This includes, but is not limited to, product content, blogging \(content marketing\) content, promotional content, business information content, educational content.

Alternate styles of content include internal intranet content \(Learning Management\), instructional content to control environments or interactive digital experiences, or content that is primarily interacted with by voice commands. 

### Powering Multiple Digital Presentations

Websites are the most common vehicle for digital content consumption. That is why we have the [Site Engine](web/) to quickly get search engine friendly websites off the ground from a content instance. As we progress further into our digital world, websites are not the only place digital content lives or is consumed. A content instance really thrives when its content powers multiple presentations simultaneously. The most common example is article \(content marketing\) content loading both on a website and a mobile app. The value of that is two-fold, the content owner gain search engine rich website content while also leveraging a mobile app to use push notification to their user base.

### Cloud Content Instances vs. Open-Source Content Management Systems \(CMS\)

To launch content in the past a developer would often setup open-source website software \(CMS\) or statically launch files onto a web server. This is a quick way to get a project off the ground, and if its an open-source CMS, the content can be edited right way. The primary issues with that setup is revolves around business needs and transportation of content.  

* **Content is Siloed:** Lives on a database installed on a remote server tied to a single application. This results in the same content living in multiple places that requires repeated updates to distribute the same content across multiple presentations.
* **Software Decay:** Updates may not be possible after customization of the CMS.
* **Flailing Security:** Maintenance is a necessary evil of open-source servers and software, a developer must stay on top of monthly, event daily changes to protect the installation.
* **Growing Maintenance:** When multiple website are needed, multiple software and/or server installs are necessary. That increases the time it takes to stay on top of maintenance. 
* **Scalability & Reliability:**  If demand outweighs the resources allocated to a single software/server setup, performance will weaken and the website may not serve in a timely fashion, or even at all when under consumer demand.
