# Roles & Permissions

User Roles and Permissions are applied to User or Team access to Content Instances. Controls range from types of resources they can edit to whether they can save, create, delete or publish.

All users are managed by Site Administrators. Access and roles are specific to the users role to a single instance, or the team's role to a single connection to other Zesty.io platform instances.
